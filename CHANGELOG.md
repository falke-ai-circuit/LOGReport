# Changelog

## [v3.9.10] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Version display** — Health endpoint now returns the build-injected version (via `main.version` ldflag) instead of hardcoded "1.0.0". CLI `--version` prints `LOGReport v3.9.10 (windows/amd64)`. Frontend StatusBar and Dashboard show the real version from health API.
- **Commander: command input visibility** — Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: auto` on the tab content container so the TelnetTerminal command input bar is always visible at the bottom and not clipped.
- **Commander: Log Viewer hint text** — Updated from "Double-click a file" to "Click a file" to match the new single-click behavior.

## [v3.9.9] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Settings: Scan Method toggle** — New `scan_method` setting in Settings page with dropdown: "Remote BU (BsTool TCP Protocol)" (default) or "Local Directory (.sys files on disk)". No automatic fallback between methods — the selected method is used exclusively.
- **Nodes page: Clear Nodes button** — Two-word button "Clear Nodes" in the Nodes page toolbar that removes all detected node configs from the project with a confirmation dialog.

### Fixed

- **Double .log files** — LOG-type tokens were creating duplicate tree entries and duplicate files on disk because `buildFileName` for LOG type doesn't include token ID (`{station}_{ip}.log`), so multiple LOG tokens produced identical filenames. Now deduplicated: one LOG file per station+IP combination. Fixed in `BuildTree`, `BuildFileTree` (3 locations), and `createLogStructure`.
- **Commander: single-click opens files** — Clicking on .li/.fbc/.rpc/.log files in the Commander node tree now opens file content on the right side (Log Viewer tab) immediately, instead of requiring a double-click.

## [v3.9.3] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- **NodesPage: duplicate file viewer** — Removed floating panel that overlapped with modal (both rendered simultaneously, z-index conflict)
- **NodesPage: missing context menu handlers** — Added bstool_errlog, rpc_clear, fbc_scan, rpc_scan, clear_logs actions (5 dead buttons fixed)
- **NodeTree: parentNode never passed** — Context menu labels for group/token nodes were empty ("Print All FBC Tokens for " with no name). Fixed by adding parentNode to TreeBranchProps and passing it through recursive calls
- **NodeTree: fileColor not applied to tokens** — Token-type nodes used statusColor instead of fileColor. Now token nodes show green/yellow/red based on line count
- **NodeTree: undefined line_count** — Files with unknown line count appeared green (has content). Now show gray (unknown)
- **NodeTree: dead code removed** — Unreachable second token handler block (lines 237-260) that provided fewer menu items
- **CommanderLayout: auto-set log root** — Now auto-sets log root on page load (same as NodesPage)


All notable changes to LOGReport will be documented in this file.

## [v3.9.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Horizontal top navigation** — Dashboard, Nodes, Reports, Commander as horizontal tabs across the top, replacing the left sidebar (Layout.tsx)
- **Nodes as standalone main area** — New `NodesPage.tsx` component with node tree (left panel) + station cards + sys file ingest + "Open File" button + colorized log viewer. Moved from Commander sub-tab to its own main navigation area.
- **Colorized log file viewer** — Log content rendered with color coding: green (#22c55e) = normal output, red (#ef4444) = errors, yellow (#f59e0b) = prompts/status, teal (#10b981) = success. Available in both NodesPage and CommanderLayout.
- **Double-click on token nodes** — Token-type nodes in the tree now respond to double-click, constructing the file path from log_root + station + type + filename and opening content in the log viewer.
- **"Open File Content" in token context menus** — Right-click on FBC/RPC/LOG token nodes now includes "Open File Content" action.
- **Value persistence across tab changes** — Telnet host/port and BsTool server name/comm line/bstool path are saved to localStorage on connect/execute and restored on component mount. Values survive tab switches.

### Changed

- **CommanderLayout simplified** — Removed Nodes tab, sys scan panel, and NodesTabContent function. Commander now has: Telnet, BsTool, Scan, Log Viewer tabs only. Node tree stays on left for right-click commands.
- **App.tsx routes** — `/nodes` now renders `NodesPage` instead of old `NodeBrowser`. Old NodeBrowser preserved at `/nodes/browser`.
- **embed.go** — Reverted to `web/dist/*` path (was temporarily changed to `web/dist-new/*` during build directory issues).

### Fixed

- **handlers.go listReportsHandler** — Fixed broken variable declarations: `reports` was assigned with `=` without prior declaration in scope; `err` was used from wrong scope. Rewrote with proper `var` declarations.
- **handlers_projects.go** — Added missing `os` import; fixed `nodesConfigPathForProject` call to use `s.` prefix and `strconv.FormatInt` for int64→string conversion.
- **internal/types/sysfile.go** — Added missing `SlotNum int` and `IsFieldbus bool` fields to `SysFileNode` struct (were in deployed binary but not committed to git).

### Commits

| # | Type | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | feat | Horizontal top nav, NodesPage, colorized logs, double-click tokens, value persistence |
| 2 | fix | handlers.go listReportsHandler variable scope, handlers_projects.go missing os import, sysfile.go missing struct fields |


## [v1.1.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Template "default" not found** — Report generation failed when no template was specified because the API defaults to `"default"` but no template was seeded in the store. Fixed in `internal/report/generator.go`: when template is `"default"` and not found, fall through with `nil` (use built-in title "LOGReport — {node}"). Custom templates still fail hard if not found. Found via R-LIVE phase.

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **BsTool Wrapper** — Go wrapper for the proprietary Windows `BsTool.exe` utility. Manages subprocess lifecycle with 10 improvements over the Python original: configurable timeout, structured error types, output encoding detection, line filtering, dry-run mode, graceful shutdown, platform-adaptive executor (Windows real, Linux stub with 501 UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM), and 96.3% test coverage.
- **POST /api/v1/bstool/errlog** — New API endpoint for BsTool error log extraction (12th endpoint).
- **R-LIVE Review Phase** — Mandatory live binary review in dev-cycle loop: reviewer starts binary, curls every endpoint, tests GUI surfaces with real HTTP requests. Auto-re-loop on FAIL with exact failure evidence. Found and fixed StatusBar bug (wrong URL `/api/v1/health` → `/health`, wrong field names `db`/`nodes` → `db_status`/`node_count`).
- **Creative Integration Testing** — Reviewer doctrine expanded: for any deliverable talking to an external system, reviewer builds a misbehaving mock and tests with real I/O. Mock DNA telnet server built and used to validate Go telnet client (10/12 live tests PASS, 3 edge cases discovered).
- **`.gitkeep` sentinel** — `web/dist/.gitkeep` committed to prevent empty `//go:embed`; `main.go` startup guard warns if embed contains only `.gitkeep`.
